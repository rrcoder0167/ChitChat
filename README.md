# ChitChat [CURRENTLY WORKING PROGRESS]

project started on jan. 10, 2023

Hey there, the dev of chitchat(riddhiman) here. ChitChat is basically an application meant to be an alternative to google chat/discord but a somewhat combination of the two allowing you to have private, secure conversations in a chatting application.

Looking to expand this project to:
yeetsquad
r58playz
...and more

What I'm working on now: Accept/ Decline Friend Request Functionality

So I finished the send friend request functionality and now I'm onto accepting or declining friend requests. Declining is easy but accepting is hard...

Thanks

# Installation

you can try out the code now or wait for the official website/dmg/exe app to come out.
