# ChitChat [CURRENTLY WORKING PROGRESS]

project started on jan. 10, 2023

Hey there, the dev of chitchat(riddhiman) here. ChitChat is basically an application meant to be an alternative to google chat/discord but a somewhat combination of the two allowing you to have private, secure conversations in a chatting application.

Looking to expand this project to:
yeetsquad
r58playz
...and more

What I'm working on now: html layout of webpage

Thanks
