# Orange Chat [CURRENTLY WORKING PROGRESS]

project started on jan. 10, 2023

Hey there, the dev of chitchat(riddhiman) here. Orange is basically an application meant to be an alternative to google chat/discord but a somewhat combination of the two allowing you to have private, secure conversations in a chatting application. I'm working on adding special roles for people and adding fun easter eggs along the way.

Looking to expand this project to:
yeetsquad
r58playz
...and more

What I'm working on now: Converting from SQL Alchemy to Mongo DB

So I finished the send friend request functionality and now I'm onto accepting or declining friend requests. Declining is easy but accepting is hard...

Thanks
